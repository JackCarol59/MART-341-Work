    <h1>Upcoming Star Wars Film</h1>
    <hr>
      <h2> Predictions, Plot-Twists, Possibilities!</h2>
      You're here because you are so excited for Star Wars: The Last Jedi(style) that you wanted to hear someone else make conjectures on ensuing action. Good for you?
<h2>Where We Left Off</h2>
Han Solo was murdered by his son (Donald Trump Sad), Kylo Ren...this guy is bad to the bone.
The Starkiller Base (aka Death Star Dos) was destroyed
...Rey, the newest protagonist looked like she was about to get all training-montage-y with Luke Skywalker.....SO WHATS GONNA HAPPEN?

      <h2> Who IS (ital)the Last Jedi?</h2>
      Probably the most important and looming question as we know there are at least 2 Jedis in Luke Skywalker and Rey....but could the last jedi be Kylo Ren? We'll soon find out
<h2>Who are Rey's Parents?</h2>
  You were expecting a long bodied answer, but I got a simple one. It's Luke.....but who the mother is? We may never find out.
  <h2>"It's time for the Jedi to end"</h2>
  <h3> -Luke Skywalker</h3>
  This line from the teaser trailer leaves the audience with many questions. Questions i can't answer.

  <h3> See you in the front row!</h3>

      <h2> Predictions, Plot-Twists, Possibilities!</h2>
      <p>You're here because you are so excited for <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> that you wanted to hear someone else make conjectures on ensuing action. Good for you? May the Force Be With Us</p>
<h2>Where We Left Off</h2>
<ul><li>Han Solo was murdered by his son (Donald-Trump-Sad), Kylo Ren...this guy is bad to the bone.</li>
<li>The Starkiller Base (aka Death Star Dos) was destroyed</li>
<li>Rey, the newest protagonist looked like she was about to get all training-montage-y with Luke Skywalker.....<strong>SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?</strong></li></ul>

      <h2> Who <i>IS</i> the Last Jedi?</h2>
      <p>Probably the most important and looming question as we know there are at least 2 Jedis in Luke Skywalker and Rey....but could the last jedi be Kylo Ren? We'll soon find out</p>
<h2>Who are Rey's Parents?</h2>
  <p>You were expecting a long bodied answer, but I got a simple one. It's Luke.....but who the mother is? We may never find out.</p>
  <h2>"It's time for the Jedi to end"</h2>
  <h3> -Luke Skywalker</h3>
  <p>This line from the teaser trailer leaves the audience with many questions. Questions I can't answer.</p>

- I took way too much time to get everything set up, hopefully it is a smoother ride from here.
- Many a help sessions and countless minutes of confusion

That covers Q's 1 and 2 now for the rest:

1. I had alot of problems installing some of the programs onto my machine, but with lots of help coming into lab i was able to get things on track.
2. Just learning the ropes really. Interesting stuff for sure.
3. I didnt help my fellow classmates....YET.
